## Background

This package contains the FVM/Wasm interactions for the Recall network. It is a fork of certain packages from the [Zondax](https://github.com/Zondax/izari-filecoin) FVM library, altered to support web environments.

## Usage

There entrypoints are exported:

- `@recallnet/fvm/address`: Wasm/FVM-specific address utilities
- `@recallnet/fvm/artifacts`: Related low-level address components
- `@recallnet/fvm/utils`: Utility functions like CBOR or LEB128 encoding/decoding

Most often, you won't need to interact with this package directly.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the tests:

```bash
